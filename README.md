# Rice-GWAS


Welcome! This repo contains multiple GWASs performed on processed SNP data, following the analysis found in my [Rice-PCA-SNPs](https://github.com/aangush/Rice-PCA-SNPs) repo. This workflow was adapted from the course BIS 180L Genomics Laboratory at UC Davis, and the SNPs examined were derived from a bulk RNA seq experiment on different
strains of rice.

### File Structure
______

This repo contains three directories: `input`, `output`, and `scripts`. `input` and `output` contain input and output data to be processed/retrieved by different programs (usually stored locally). `scripts` contains an .Rmd file and the associated html version which can be used to view all inputs and outputs of the code used in this analysis. Also in `scripts` is an R script that contains all R in the analysis. The workflow in this repo was performed entirely with R.
